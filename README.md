# rat (routers are terrible)
rat is a client-side router which makes it easy to map javascript functions to URL pathnames.

## Installation
If rat becomes popular, I will host it on a CDN for fast delivery. Until then, copy the source code [directly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phillip-England/rat/main/index.js).

```html
<head>
    <script src='/path/to/rat.js'></script>
</head>
```
